    "Recursion in the tower of hanoi algorithm works by breaking down a larger problem into smaller subproblems The key observation is that moving n disks can be expressed in terms of moving n-1 disks,\n",

    "THis is the simlest and serves as the base case for recursion\n",
    "* Recursive Case\n",
    "For n > 1, the algorithm first recursively moves the top (n-1) disks from the source rod to an auxiliary rod. This step is the recursive call with the source, auxiliary, and destination rods swapped compared to the original call.\n",
    "\n",
    "After moving the smaller stack to the auxiliary rod, the algorithm prints the move of the nth disk from the source rod to the destination rod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it recursively moves the (n-1) disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod. This is again a recursive call with the source, destination, and auxiliary rods swapped compared to the original call.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the algorithm follows the principle of breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving those subproblems recursively, and then combining the solutions to get the solution for the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The movements of disks between rods are accomplished by printing out the steps in each recursive call. The order of the moves ensures that the constraints of the Tower of Hanoi problem (moving only one disk at a time and not placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one) are satisfied. \n",
    "The recursion takes care of the sequencing and interleaving of moves, making sure that the entire stack of disks is moved from the source rod to the destination rod in the correct order.\n",
